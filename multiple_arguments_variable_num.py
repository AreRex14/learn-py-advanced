# It is possible to declare functions which receive a variable number of arguments, using the following syntax:
def foo(first, second, third, *therest):
    print("First: %s" % first)
    print("Second: %s" % second)
    print("Third: %s" % third)
    print("And all the rest...: %s" % list(therest))
